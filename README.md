# Stop-Super-Speeders-Hackathon
building a public transportation alert system for New York State and city DMVs to alert super speeders



## Prerequisites: TODOs before the hackathon
- Complete volunteer [registration](http://www.nyc-dssg.org) on DSSG-NYC website
- Join DSSG-NYC [Slack Group](https://join.slack.com/t/nyc-dssg/shared_invite/zt-3fhzyi936-hDjiJn05j9EKY3BH9YjXgQ)
- Review DSSG [Anti-harassment Policy](https://github.com/dssg/hitchhikers-guide/blob/master/sources/dssg-manual/conduct-culture-and-communications/README.md), and [ethical standards](https://dssgfellowship.org/2015/09/18/an-ethical-checklist-for-data-science/)
- Review Family for Safe Streets Problem Statement: https://www.familiesforsafestreets.org/about

## Hacking Deliverables:
1) Data Management Design:
- Design ETL and pipeline 
- Data structure (is it general enough in case the courts have missing variables?)
- Consider Privacy
2) Alert system trigger local DMV authorities
- Alert data management (e.g. handle of duplicate alerts)
- Accessibility
3) Data input/upload system for stake-holders (e.g. courts, DMV, etc)
- Alert management (e.g. which alerts have been sent, a way to mark follow-ups)
4) Dashboard DMV is end user:
- Design DMV dashboard - with success metrics, alerts
- indicates speeders warning system
- ability to alert to send to people who cross the 10 threshold
