# Actually, for this repo, we might want to track scripts to download data, but maybe not the data itself if it's huge. 
# However, user mentioned "push it... with complete guide". 
# The data is downloaded via script.
# Let's ignore the actual data files to be safe/clean
data/*.parquet
data/*.csv
data/*.json
# Keep the directory itself
!data/.gitkeep
